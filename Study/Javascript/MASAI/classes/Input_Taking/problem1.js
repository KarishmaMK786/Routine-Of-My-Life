let x = "10";
let y = Number(x);

console.log(y);   // Converting string into number


// another method is unary plus

let a = "10";

let b = +a;

console.log(typeof(b));


// Unary plus operator is also used to convert string to number, it is similar to Number().
// unary plus and Number() only work for single numbers
